        "\n",
        "## Purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest way to think about dynamic programming, \"DP\", is nothing more than as an approach to optimize an algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Find an algorithm that \"brute forces\" a problem\n",
        "2.  Notice that it fits into the the class of algorithms DP can optimize\n",
        "3.  Implement algorithm using DP\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic programming does **not** have anything to do with on-the-fly code generation, online reinforcement learning, editing/optimizing compiled code while it's running... or anything else fancy.  So what does it do?  Read on!\n",
        "\n",
        "## Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "So how does DP work?\n",
        "\n",
        "It boils down to a simple idea:  _don't let your code do the same work twice_.  In practice, this means that you should cache intermediate results (say, in a table).  Each time you need to evaluate a function with the same input after the first, you can look up the result in the cache rather than recomputing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "You will sometimes hear DP is used for problems whose solutions are combinations of the solutions to \"optimal subproblems\".  Unpacking this a little bit:  if each solution is just a combination of smaller versions of the same problem, and you cache the results of the smaller problems as you go, to the extent that you need those solutions in more than one place, you'll get a speed up.  For many problems, an exponential time naive implementation can be made to run in polynomial time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Don't let this sound complicated to you.**  All we're doing is adding a cache to avoid recomputing an \"expensive\" function.  Any time you see a problem that sounds like, \"Try every possible combination of X and pick the best\", you should think \"I wonder if there are any partial results here we can cache and reuse\".\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why is this important for natural language processing?\n",
        "\n",
        "The last half of the course contains a wide variety of algorithms that run passibly fast only when we apply a judicious amount of dynamic programing. Notably, both sequence tagging tasks (like part-of-speech tagging and entity recognition) and structured-prediction tasks like parsing will make heavy use of DP!"

Similarly, if you have $ways(n - 2)$ to get to the $n - 2$ step and then take a big step to stair $n$.  There is no other way to get to stair $n$ except by one of those two sets of options.

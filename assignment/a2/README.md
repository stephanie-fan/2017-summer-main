# Assignment 2: N-grams and Word Embeddings

## Due: June 7, 11:59p Pacific

This assignment consists of two parts:

* (12 points) [Smoothed n-gram Models](part1/part1_ngram.ipynb)
* (8 points) [Exploring Word Embeddings](part2/part2_embeddings.ipynb)

Part 1 is somewhat longer than Part 2, but it depends only on material from Week 2 that you've (hopefully!) already seen.

Please read the instructions carefully in the notebook and, especially, in the code documentation for the functions you'll need to implement. As always, come to OH or post on Piazza if you have any questions!

This assignment builds on the demo notebooks for Week 2 and Week 3, so you may want to review those before you start each part:
* Week 2: [lm1.ipynb](../../materials/week2/lm1.ipynb)
* Week 3: [embeddings.ipynb](../../materials/week3/embeddings.ipynb)

You might also want to look over the notes on Python dictionaries if you're not familiar with `enumerate`, `iteritems`, `defaultdict`, or `dict.get`: [part1/dict_notes.md](part1/dict_notes.md)

As always, you should commit your changes often with `git add` and `git commit`. As this is a new assignment, there may be bugfixes and corrections - so keep your eye on Piazza and GitHub for any updates.

## Submission instructions
